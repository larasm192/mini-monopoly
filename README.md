# 🏠 Mini Monopoly

A simplified browser-based Monopoly game built with modular JavaScript and functional programming principles. Designed as part of a Design Engineering coursework project, this game focuses on core gameplay mechanics including player turns, property management, jail logic, and win conditions—all presented through an interactive web interface.

## 🎮 Features

- Turn-based gameplay for 2 players
- Dice roll and animated token movement
- Property buying and rent logic
- Jail system with decision-making mechanics
- Win detection when a player runs out of money
- Visual feedback via dynamic UI updates and popup prompts

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6)** – game logic & modular architecture  
- **HTML/CSS** – structure and styling  
- **JSDoc** – code documentation  
- **Functional Programming** – using [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) for utility logic  
- **Mocha** – unit testing (if implemented)

## 📂 Project Structure

```
├── Monopoly.js            # Core game logic module
├── popup.js               # Reusable popup interface module
├── main.js                # DOMContentLoaded setup & UI binding
├── index.html             # Main game UI
├── style.css              # Styling (optional)
├── assets/                # Dice images, property cards, player tokens
└── README.md              # Project documentation
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser  
3. Click "Roll" to begin playing

> ✅ No installation or server setup required – this is a front-end-only project.

## 🧠 Key Learning Outcomes

- Applied **multidisciplinary design thinking** to balance gameplay, UI/UX, and code structure  
- Practiced **pure function design** and clean separation between UI and logic  
- Strengthened understanding of **state management** and interactive programming
